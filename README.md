Created to help me extract starsector mods but I'm sure it could be used anywhere. Its WIP not free of showstopping bugs.

Use the `-s` or the `--source` argument to specify a source path which can point to a directory containing one or more compressed files or directly to a compressed file.

Use the `-d` or the `--destination` argument to specify a destination directory for the extraction output.
